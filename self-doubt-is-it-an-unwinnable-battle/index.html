        <p>Let me confess something.</p>

<p>There’s something wrong with me—or at least, that’s what I often believe.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been at war with self-doubt. It’s exhausting to give your all while constantly whispering to yourself that you’ll never be enough.</p>

<p>Looking back, it almost feels like life followed some invisible straight line, neatly connecting the dots to where I am now. But truth is, that path was anything but straight. I wandered. I hesitated. I got lost.</p>

<p>I knew where I wanted to go. But somehow, I couldn’t walk toward it. No guide, no map—just an endless loop of second-guessing myself, afraid of what failure might do to me.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I was a kid, I loved everything about technology. I dreamed of creating things myself. We had a computer at home, but no one around me could teach me how to use it beyond the basics. We didn’t even have internet until I was 14.</p>

<p>By then, I had already drifted. Surrounded by smart people, I felt I didn’t belong in that world. I gave up on the dream. I just wanted to enjoy what others made, not build anything of my own.</p>

<p>I don’t remember when exactly school stopped making sense to me. I barely passed anything. The only class I did well in was English, which made me think about choosing a language-related major. My parents didn’t approve. I even considered Psychology, something more human, but they shut that down too.</p>

<p>Eventually, we compromised. They pushed for engineering. I didn’t care anymore, so I picked a random major in a less-known university—just to get it over with.</p>

<p>It was miserable.</p>

<p>For two years, I kept failing classes—especially those filled with math and physics. I thought I was doomed. But later, when programming classes came in, things changed. I wasn’t just passing—I was doing well. More than that, I enjoyed it. I even started helping friends who were struggling, and surprisingly, they said I was good at explaining things.</p>

<p>That made something click.</p>

<p>Maybe I could teach. Maybe that could be my future.</p>

<p>But to do that, I’d need a better degree.</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s when my self-doubt came back stronger than ever.</p>

<p>I wanted to study abroad. I believed being around cutting-edge tech would shape me. But I doubted I could get a scholarship. Private universities were out of the question—too expensive. So, I settled for a local public uni. People said I was lucky to get in, and I think they were right. It was a new major. Maybe they just needed more students. I passed the basic entrance tests, but even then, I didn’t feel like I earned my spot.</p>

<p>When I saw the curriculum, my heart sank. So many algorithm-heavy courses—so much math. I was terrified.</p>

<p>I told myself: If I fail this, I have nothing left.</p>

<p>So I did something I’d never done before: I bought an advanced math textbook and started learning ahead.</p>

<p>It was hell.</p>

<p>But it worked.</p>

<p>Despite every voice in my head telling me I’d fail again, I aced the class. I got an A in advanced math.</p>

<p>Me. The guy who thought he could never do it.</p>

<p>That one win changed something in me. I started to believe, just a little.</p>

<hr />

<p>But self-doubt never really left. It still lingers in the background—sometimes loud, sometimes quiet. But always there.</p>

<p>I remember admiring someone who worked at a state-owned company, thinking, He’s a real man. A provider. I’ll never be like that.</p>

<p>Yet somehow, I got into a similar company’s management trainee program on my first try—even after telling my parents not to get their hopes up.</p>

<p>Later, I got offers from tech companies. I didn’t think I could survive outside of the structure and safety of a corporation. So I said no. I stayed.</p>

<p>I’m a family man. That’s both a blessing and a weight. Eventually, I knew I had to try again—for them, and for me. I gave it my all, and finally, I walked away from my comfort zone.</p>

<hr />

<p>My next job was with an offshore team, working with foreigners. I assumed I’d be invisible—just another cog in the system. I told myself: You won’t make friends. You’ll just get the job done.</p>

<p>Then the VP visited.</p>

<p>I wasn’t excited. I just wanted to meet other offshore folks. But when I heard the VP speak, something shifted. He believed in the company. He had vision. It sparked something in me.</p>

<p>The next year, I met the CTO. He wasn’t just a leader—he was kind. He saw me as a person, not just an employee.</p>

<p>I gave everything I had to that company. And slowly, every doubt I had at the start… disappeared.</p>

<p>When I left the company, I didn’t feel like I was running away. I felt proud. Fulfilled.</p>

<p>My teammates? They weren’t just coworkers anymore. We shared stories, laughter, even personal contact to stay in touch.</p>

<p>The man I never thought I could become—that’s who I turned out to be.</p>

<p>They saw it. They believed in me.</p>

<hr />

<p>The most recent doubt?</p>

<p>I thought I’d be stuck. Forever doing the same job in the same place. Every rejection from abroad felt like confirmation: You’re not good enough. Every email hurt. But I kept applying.</p>

<p>And now?</p>

<p>I landed offers abroad.</p>

<p>I packed up. I left.</p>

<p>I’m working in a place I’d never imagined.</p>

<p>It’s terrifying.</p>

<p>Maybe this is just another chapter in the self-doubt saga. Maybe the fight isn’t over.</p>

<p>But I’m still fighting.</p>

<hr />

<p>So… is self-doubt an unwinnable battle?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Is it easy to win?</p>

<p>Hell no.</p>

<p>It’s painful. Relentless.</p>

<p>But I’ve learned this: Sometimes, all you need is one moment that proves you wrong. One little crack in the belief that you’ll never make it.</p>

<p>I’ve been lucky. I’ve had a few of those moments.</p>

<p>And I’ve had my family beside me through all of it. Without them, I might’ve missed my shot.</p>

<p>So I count my blessings.</p>

<p>And when doubt creeps in, I remember: the only way is forward.</p>

<p>You can fall. You can scream at the sky. You can hate yourself for a moment. But you get up.</p>

<p>And try again.</p>
